# docker-compose-laravel
A pretty simplified Docker Compose workflow that sets up a LEMP network of containers for local eQRS development. You can view the full article that inspired this repo [here](https://dev.to/aschmelyun/the-beauty-of-docker-for-local-laravel-development-13c0).

## Usage

To get started, make sure you have [Docker installed](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install/) on your system, and then clone this repository.

Next, navigate in your terminal to the directory you cloned this, create an .env file by running `cp .env.example .env` and spin up the containers for the web server by running `docker-compose up -d --build nginx`.

After that completes, initialize and update reims to the latest commit in its repository, by running `git submodule update --init`

Then create .env file in the submodule path by issuing the following commands:

- `cd src`
- `cp .env.example .env`

**Note**: Database enviroment varibles values in the submodudule should have same values as in the parent .env file. 

Bringing up the Docker Compose network with `nginx` instead of just using `up`, ensures that only our site's containers are brought up at the start, instead of all of the command containers as well. The following are built for our web server, with their exposed ports detailed:

- **nginx** - `:80`
- **mysql** - `:3306`
- **php** - `:9000`
- **redis** - `:6379`
- **mailhog** - `:8025` 

Three additional containers are included that handle Composer, NPM, and Artisan commands *without* having to have these platforms installed on your local computer. Use the following command examples from your project root, modifying them to fit your particular use case.

- `docker compose run --rm composer install`
- `docker compose run --rm npm install`
- `docker compose run --rm artisan key:generate`
- `docker compose run --rm artisan migrate`
- `docker compose run --rm artisan db:seed`
- `docker compose run --rm artisan storage:link`

## Permissions Issues

If you encounter any issues with filesystem permissions while visiting your application or running a container command, try completing one of the sets of steps below.

**If you are using your server or local environment as the root user:**

- Bring any container(s) down with `docker-compose down`
- Replace any instance of `php.dockerfile` in the docker-compose.yml file with `php.root.dockerfile`
- Re-build the containers by running `docker-compose build --no-cache`

**If you are using your server or local environment as a user that is not root:**

- Bring any container(s) down with `docker-compose down`
- In your terminal, run `export UID=$(id -u)` and then `export GID=$(id -g)`
- If you see any errors about readonly variables from the above step, you can ignore them and continue
- Re-build the containers by running `docker-compose build --no-cache`

Then, either bring back up your container network or re-run the command you were trying before, and see if that fixes it.

## Usage in Production

While this template is created for local development, it's robust enough to be used in REIMS deployments. The biggest recommendation would be to ensure that HTTPS is enabled by making additions to the `nginx/default.conf` file and utilizing something like [Let's Encrypt](https://hub.docker.com/r/linuxserver/letsencrypt) to produce an SSL certificate.

## MailHog

The current version of Laravel (9 as of today) uses MailHog as the default application for testing email sending and general SMTP work during local development. Using the provided Docker Hub image, getting an instance set up and ready is simple and straight-forward. The service is included in the `docker-compose.yml` file, and spins up alongside the webserver and database services.

To see the dashboard and view any emails coming through the system, visit [localhost:8025](http://localhost:8025) after running `docker-compose up -d site`.
